          <p class="dark">
            Lions Club, a mecca for public golf featuring five 18-hole regulation golf courses including the world-renowned Black Course.
         </p>

         <p class="light">
           <strong>Blue Course</strong>
           <br><br>
            The Blue Course was one of the three courses designed by Tillinghast.
            In 1960, it was redesigned by Alfred Tull to provide room for the Yellow Course.
            The front nine are considered very challenging, with an easier back nine to finish a round of golf.
            Some of the slopes are fairly steep.

        <p class="dark">
          <strong>Green Course</strong>
          <br><br>
          The Green Course is the first of the five courses.
          This is a gently-sloped course that features small greens.
          It is considered an excellent course for the novice and casual golfer,
          yet it can be challenging when played from the regulation tees.

         <strong>Black Course</strong>
         <br><br>

         The Black Course is a difficult and challenging course that should be played only by low-handicap golfers. The course is for walkers only and its slope rating is one of the highest in the northeast.
         The narrow fairways, high roughs, well placed bunkers and small greens help to make this an extremely difficult course.

      <p class="dark">
        <strong>Red Course</strong>
        <br><br>
        The Red Course is a very different Tillinghast course.
        It features long par 4s and dogleg holes and one of the toughest starting holes in the country.

     <p class="light">
      <strong>Yellow Course</strong>
       <br><br>
       The Yellow Course was opened for play in 1958. The Yellow, with a few steep slopes,
        is considered by many to be the easiest of the five courses. It can be a challenge to the novice
        and casual golfer but, when played from the Championship tees, can be a true test of a golfer's skills.
